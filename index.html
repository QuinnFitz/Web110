       <p>Luke is a singer/ songwriter from Seattle, Washington, playing acoustic guitar and singing soulful pop and rock songs in the vein of John Mayer, Elliott Smith, and Jack Johnson. Picking up guitar at age 12, he began to write his own songs as well, and took special interest in music as a junior in high school after joining the choir. Senior year, he continued on in choir until dropping out of high school to move closer to Seattle; he moved in with his sister and began working in a coffee shop, at which point he discovered the local open mic scene where he debuted the music he had written. He has published several demos and continued playing live at venues like the Stone Way Caf√© in Seattle up as of 2020.</p>
